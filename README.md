<h3>By Nikita Andrianov</h3>

Dear Person who is reading this,<br>
Please read this document before diving into my solution for the backend assignment.

Language that i choose for this assignment - Java.<br>

Framework that i used- Java Spring Boot.<br>

I am running MySQL database as an Azure Cloud Service.<br>

Services are deployed on Heroku<br>

For monitoring i am using Spring Boot Actuator<br>
For validation i am using Spring Boot Started Validation<br>

Restful APIs are documented with usage of Swagger<br>

Since i have been working with a Postman, i also generated API documentation there<br>

Since the last version:
- Improved comments(Especially in Controllers).
- Improved Validation for Wolf and Pack components.
- Improved Response Handling for handleMethodArgumentNotValid Exception.
- Added new validations for some properties in Wolf.java.
